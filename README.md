Infinite Dungeon
-------------
Eventually this project aims to make a fully interactive
[Roguelike](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) game using the original 
[Legend of Zelda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda_(video_game\)) as its setting. 

Right now it's a random maze generator with a thin layer of navigation atop it, code named "[Map Quest](http://www.buyog.com/code/id/mapQuest.html)".
